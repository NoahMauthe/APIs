# Android Store APIs
A project containing APIs for some Android App Stores. Designed to be used non-interactively, i.e. by a crawler.
Please note that these APIs try to reimplement internal APIs that are subject to change, so they might stop working unexpectedly.

## Google Play API

An unofficial API for Google Play that requires login credentials.
Parts of the Google Play API are taken from another [googleplay-api](https://github.com/NoMore201/googleplay-api).

## F-Droid API

An unofficial API that simply parses the [F-Droid website](https://f-droid.org)
